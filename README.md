# CSE341-Microprocessors

This course introduces the architecture, working mechanism and functionality of different microprocessors. This course primarily focuses on the Intel 8086 microprocessor’s architecture, its memory partitioning and registers, the instruction set, timing diagrams and its interrupt structure. Additionally, the concepts I/O addressing and the idea behind Direct Memory Access and its cascading are also discussed. Lastly, the course concludes with some concepts of the more advanced Intel 80x86 microprocessors and their basic architecture. The course includes a compulsory 3-hour laboratory work each week.

# Course Objectives
The objectives of this course are to:

a. Getting familiar with the components of a microcomputer system and getting associated with the internal architecture of Intel 8086 microprocessor.

b. Introducing the instruction set of 8086 microprocessor, its different addressing modes, and address translation techniques.

c. Discuss the concepts of clock signals and formulate timing diagram.

d. Explain interrupt handling in 8086 and the basic functionalities of the 8259A PIC

e. Assess the advantages of direct memory access and discuss the 8237 DMA controller.

f. Introducing later processors (80x86) and compare their components and basic features.

g. Understand assembly language, develop assembly language programs and learn how to interface them to various devices using the hardware kit.
